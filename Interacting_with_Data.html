		<p><center> In this graph, it can be seen that as voter frequency increases, the level of education and level of income increases.<p> "Sporadic" is the most common category of voting frequency whilst "Rarely/Never" is the least common. Overall, a higher education level is associated with a higher income level for voters.</p></center></p>

		<p><center>This graph shows the change of absentee voting and voter turnout every two years from 2014 to 2022 in Virginia counties and cities. <p>2016 and 2020 are seen to have some of the greatest percent voter turnout across all regions, which is assumed to be because those years being presidential and congressional election years. Additionally, 2020 is seen to have the greatest % absent voters across all regions, which is assumed to be because it occured during the COVID-19 Pandemic, causing a surge in absentee voter numbers.<p></center></p>

		<p><center>This graph differenties counties/cities in Virginia from one another based on percent voter turnout in 2022. It is seen through the use of a color scale that a majority of counties and cities had a voter turnout of around 50%.<p>Counties and cities with a higher percent voter turnout (in the 55-67% range) are located in more northern/eastern areas. This is represented with the darker purple colors in those areas. Those with a lower percent voter turnout (in the 33-46% range) are located in more southern/western areas.</p></center></p>

		<p><center> I used headings with different font color and sizes to clearly create sections for each of the graphs presented, to increase readability of this web page, and emphasize titles. Additionally, I added added a small paragraph of info under each graph to help guide readers to further analyze the plots. I also made the background color of the entire web page a shade of light grey to help highlight the graphs (which have a background color of white).</center></p>
